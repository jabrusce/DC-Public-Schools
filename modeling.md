# Modeling
**Null Model**

The null model for our dataset will be an accuracy of 32% as the most-frequent value in our target (star rating) is 3-stars and is approximately 32% of our target variable. The values in our target are as follows:
- 1 Star: 13%
- 2 Star: 26%
- **3 Star: 32%**
- 4 Star: 15%
- 5 Star: 13%

Our models incorperated data 
We tried many different regression models but ultimately found the Ridge Model to most accurately predict our target variable.
Models that performed well:
- Ridge Model
- Decision Trees
- KNN
- Random Forest Model
- Neural Network

Models that did not performed well:
- Lasso Model
- Elastic Net Modelnet_pipe
- Bagging Regressor
- Adaboost & Gradientboost
- SVR
